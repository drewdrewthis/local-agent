## Core Rules

**Browser Automation:** When performing browser automation tasks, pause and tell the user before closing the browser session to allow them to verify, intervene, or handle any manual steps.

**Rule Updates:** When the user provides explicit rule-like instructions (e.g., "next time, pause and tell me before..."), update the agent rules documentation accordingly to incorporate the new guidance.
